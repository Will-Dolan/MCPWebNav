      "content": "This article was reviewed by a member of Caltech's Faculty.\n\nImagine touching the surface of a pond at two different points at the same time. Waves would spread outward from each point, eventually overlapping to form a more complex pattern. This is a superposition of waves. Similarly, in quantum science, objects such as electrons and photons have wavelike properties that can combine and become what is called superposed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile waves on the surface of a pond are formed by the movement of water, quantum waves are mathematical. They are expressed as equations that describe the probabilities of an object existing in a given state or having a particular property. The equations might provide information on the probability of an electron moving at a specific speed or residing in a certain location. When an electron is in superposition, its different states can be thought of as separate outcomes, each with a particular probability of being observed. An electron might be said to be in a superposition of two different velocities or in two places at once. Understanding superposition may help to advance quantum technology such as quantum computers.\n\nThe concept of quantum superposition might be difficult to visualize. Traditional descriptions have used the analogy of a coin that is heads up and tails up at the same time, or the famous Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment, in which physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger imagined placing a cat in a sealed box along with a poisonous substance that has an equal chance of killing the cat\u2014or not\u2014within an hour. Schr\u00f6dinger proposed that, at the end of the hour, the cat could be said to be both alive and dead, in a superposition of states until the box is opened, and that the act of observation randomly determines whether the cat is alive or dead. Schr\u00f6dinger intended the example to demonstrate what he saw as the absurdity of quantum science.\n\nIn mathematical terms, superposition can be thought of as an equation that has more than one solution. When we solve x2 = 4, x can either be 2 or \u20132. Both answers are correct. Superposed wave functions will be more complicated to solve, but they can be approached with the same mindset.\n\nMany experiments have been conducted that definitively prove the existence of superposition. One example recruits the help of light filters: screens that selectively block light, such as those found in polarized sunglasses or camera lenses.\n\nMost of the light we see around us is a combination of many different waves coming from the sun and other sources. The peaks and valleys of these waves are rotated in different directions at once. In other words, the light is in a superposition of these different polarized states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs light waves interact with their surroundings, their properties change. Light that reflects off of the surface of a lake or snow-covered ground will be more likely to be polarized horizontally. If this light then encounters a filter that permits only vertically polarized light to pass through, the reflection will be blocked. This is how polarized sunglasses filter out the glare from reflective surfaces on a bright day.\n\nSuperposition becomes apparent when we arrange more than one filter in different ways to tease out additional properties of light. Light that passes through a horizontal filter will have a 100 percent chance of passing through a second horizontal filter, i.e., all of it will pass through. If this second filter is gradually rotated toward a vertical orientation, the chance of the light passing through both filters steadily decreases. Half of the light will pass through when the filter reaches the diagonal (45 degrees), and no light will pass through when the filter is vertical.\n\nIf superposition did not exist, light would be completely blocked as soon as the second filter was rotated by even a fraction of a degree because all of the light that went through the first filter would be strictly horizontally polarized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, adding a diagonal filter between the horizontal and vertical filters allows some light to go all the way through the system. This is also a result of superposition. The new filter will permit 50 percent of the light coming through the horizontal filter to pass. Then, because the new filter is also diagonal relative to the vertical filter, the vertical filter will permit 50 percent of the light to pass through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diagonal filter acts to \"reset\" the superposition of the light by making it more likely to be vertically polarized.",

A system can be prepared such that any well-behaved, single valued, smooth function that vanishes at endpoints. When the wavefunction is not an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian, the Superposition Principle can be used to greatly simplify how we work with the wave function. This is true because the so-called normal solutions \\(\\left(\\psi_{n}(x)\\right)\\) to the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation\n\n\\[\\widehat{H} \\psi_{n}(x)=E_{n} \\psi_{n}(x)\\nonumber \\]\n\nusing the language of linear algebra, span the space of well-behaved functions that can describe the physics of the particle. That means that any arbitrary function that is 1) continuous, and 2) obeys the boundary conditions, can be expressed as a linear combination of these normal solutions:\n\n\\[\\Phi(x)=\\sum_{n} c_{n} \\psi_{n}(x)\\nonumber \\]\n\nwhere the coefficients \\(c_{n}\\) are calculated using the Fourier Transform shown below.\n\n\\[c_{n}=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Phi(x) \\psi_{n}(x) d x\\nonumber \\]\n\nThis description also has a number of other important ramifications. Consider a particle in a box system prepared so that the wavefunction is given by\n\n\\[\\Psi(x)=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}(x)+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}(x)\\nonumber \\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\\psi_{n}(x)=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{a}} \\sin \\left(\\dfrac{n \\pi x}{a}\\right)\\nonumber \\]\n\nThe first question one might ask is, \"Is the wavefunction \\(\\Psi(\\mathrm{x})\\) normalized?\" Well, let\u2019s see!\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\int_{0}^{a}(\\Psi(x))^{2} d x &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left[\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\psi_{1}+\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\psi_{2}\\right]^{2} d x \\\\ &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{1}+\\psi_{1} \\psi_{2}+\\dfrac{1}{2} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2}\\right) d x \\\\ &=\\dfrac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{1} d x+\\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{2} d x+\\dfrac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2} d x \\\\ &=\\dfrac{1}{2}(1)+(0)+\\dfrac{1}{2}(1) \\\\ &=1 \\end{aligned}\\nonumber \\]\n\n(Notice how the property \\(\\int \\psi_{i} \\psi_{j} d \\tau=\\delta_{i j}\\) has been used to simplify the problem, by making the integral of the cross product in the middle vanish, and the integrals of the first and third terms go to unity.) So the wavefunction is normalized. Now, let\u2019s evaluate the expectation value of energy \\(\\langle \\mathrm{E} \\rangle\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\langle E\\rangle &=\\int_{0}^{a} \\Psi \\hat{H} \\Psi d x \\\\ &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}\\right) \\hat{H}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}\\right) d x \\\\ &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}\\right)\\left(\\dfrac{E_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}\\right) d x \\\\ &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{2}+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2}\\right) d x \\\\ &=\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{1} d x+\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{1} d x+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{2} d x \\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2} d x \\\\ &=\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2}+0+0+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\end{aligned}\\nonumber \\]\n\nSo the expectation value is given by the average of \\(E_{1}\\) and \\(E_{2}\\). This result is only possible if half of the time the energy is measured, the observed value is \\(\\mathrm{E}_{1}\\) and the other half \\(\\mathrm{E}_{2}\\). In other words, the probability of measuring \\(E_{1}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and that of \\(E_{2}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). It is also important to note that these probabilities are given by the Fourier coefficients of\n\n\\[c_{1}=1 / \\sqrt{2}, c_{2}=1 / \\sqrt{2} \\text { and } c_{n}=0 \\text { for all other } n\\nonumber \\]\n\nIt can be concluded that the probability of measuring \\(E_{n}\\) is given by \\(\\left|c_{n}{ }^{2}\\right|\\).\n\n\\[P\\left(E_{n}\\right)=\\left|c_{n}^{2}\\right|\\nonumber \\]\n\nImagine the following scenario. A quantum mechanical particle of mass \\(m\\) in a onedimensional box of length \\(a\\) is prepared such that its wavefunction is given by \\(\\psi_{1}(\\mathrm{x})\\). Instantaneously, the length of the box increases to \\(2 a\\). The particle is no longer in an eigenstate of the new system. Rather, its wavefunction will look like the function depicted below in the MatchCad worksheet.\n\nThe function can be described as a superposition of wavefunctions that are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian that reflects the new length of the box. A MathCad worksheet that reflects this expansion is given on the next page. The larger the value of \\(\\mathrm{m}\\) selected, the better the representation of the wavefunction.\n\nThe above problem is analogous to what happens when an atom undergoes radioactive decay by something such as \\(\\beta\\)-particle emission from the nucleus. In that case, the nuclear charge suddenly changes (changing the potential energy function and thus the Hamiltonian.) The change happens effectively instantaneously compared to the time required for the atom to react. The atom suddenly finds itself in a non-eigenstate, the nature of which will govern how the atom changes in time to respond to the nuclear decay. The superposition of eigenfunctions of the new Hamiltonian will give a description of the atom immediately following the decay, and the overall wavefunction will evolve in time based on how it is predicted to do so according to the fifth postulate.\n\nThe superposition theorem allows for a complete description of a wavefunction according to the needs to the quantum theory - even if the wavefunction being described by a superposition of states is not an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian!

A system can be prepared such that any well-behaved, single valued, smooth function that vanishes at endpoints. When the wavefunction is not an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian, the Superposition Principle can be used to greatly simplify how we work with the wave function. This is true because the so-called normal solutions \\(\\left(\\psi_{n}(x)\\right)\\) to the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation\n\n\\[\\widehat{H} \\psi_{n}(x)=E_{n} \\psi_{n}(x)\\nonumber \\]\n\nusing the language of linear algebra, span the space of well-behaved functions that can describe the physics of the particle. That means that any arbitrary function that is 1) continuous, and 2) obeys the boundary conditions, can be expressed as a linear combination of these normal solutions:\n\n\\[\\Phi(x)=\\sum_{n} c_{n} \\psi_{n}(x)\\nonumber \\]\n\nwhere the coefficients \\(c_{n}\\) are calculated using the Fourier Transform shown below.\n\n\\[c_{n}=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Phi(x) \\psi_{n}(x) d x\\nonumber \\]\n\nThis description also has a number of other important ramifications. Consider a particle in a box system prepared so that the wavefunction is given by\n\n\\[\\Psi(x)=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}(x)+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}(x)\\nonumber \\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\\psi_{n}(x)=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{a}} \\sin \\left(\\dfrac{n \\pi x}{a}\\right)\\nonumber \\]\n\nThe first question one might ask is, \"Is the wavefunction \\(\\Psi(\\mathrm{x})\\) normalized?\" Well, let\u2019s see!\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\int_{0}^{a}(\\Psi(x))^{2} d x &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left[\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\psi_{1}+\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\psi_{2}\\right]^{2} d x \\\\ &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{1}+\\psi_{1} \\psi_{2}+\\dfrac{1}{2} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2}\\right) d x \\\\ &=\\dfrac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{1} d x+\\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{2} d x+\\dfrac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2} d x \\\\ &=\\dfrac{1}{2}(1)+(0)+\\dfrac{1}{2}(1) \\\\ &=1 \\end{aligned}\\nonumber \\]\n\n(Notice how the property \\(\\int \\psi_{i} \\psi_{j} d \\tau=\\delta_{i j}\\) has been used to simplify the problem, by making the integral of the cross product in the middle vanish, and the integrals of the first and third terms go to unity.) So the wavefunction is normalized. Now, let\u2019s evaluate the expectation value of energy \\(\\langle \\mathrm{E} \\rangle\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\langle E\\rangle &=\\int_{0}^{a} \\Psi \\hat{H} \\Psi d x \\\\ &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}\\right) \\hat{H}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}\\right) d x \\\\ &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}\\right)\\left(\\dfrac{E_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\psi_{2}\\right) d x \\\\ &=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{1}+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{2}+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2}\\right) d x \\\\ &=\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{1} d x+\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{1} d x+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{1} \\psi_{2} d x \\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\int_{0}^{a} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{2} d x \\\\ &=\\dfrac{E_{1}}{2}+0+0+\\dfrac{E_{2}}{2} \\end{aligned}\\nonumber \\]\n\nSo the expectation value is given by the average of \\(E_{1}\\) and \\(E_{2}\\). This result is only possible if half of the time the energy is measured, the observed value is \\(\\mathrm{E}_{1}\\) and the other half \\(\\mathrm{E}_{2}\\). In other words, the probability of measuring \\(E_{1}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and that of \\(E_{2}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). It is also important to note that these probabilities are given by the Fourier coefficients of\n\n\\[c_{1}=1 / \\sqrt{2}, c_{2}=1 / \\sqrt{2} \\text { and } c_{n}=0 \\text { for all other } n\\nonumber \\]\n\nIt can be concluded that the probability of measuring \\(E_{n}\\) is given by \\(\\left|c_{n}{ }^{2}\\right|\\).\n\n\\[P\\left(E_{n}\\right)=\\left|c_{n}^{2}\\right|\\nonumber \\]\n\nImagine the following scenario. A quantum mechanical particle of mass \\(m\\) in a onedimensional box of length \\(a\\) is prepared such that its wavefunction is given by \\(\\psi_{1}(\\mathrm{x})\\). Instantaneously, the length of the box increases to \\(2 a\\). The particle is no longer in an eigenstate of the new system. Rather, its wavefunction will look like the function depicted below in the MatchCad worksheet.\n\nThe function can be described as a superposition of wavefunctions that are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian that reflects the new length of the box. A MathCad worksheet that reflects this expansion is given on the next page. The larger the value of \\(\\mathrm{m}\\) selected, the better the representation of the wavefunction.\n\nThe above problem is analogous to what happens when an atom undergoes radioactive decay by something such as \\(\\beta\\)-particle emission from the nucleus. In that case, the nuclear charge suddenly changes (changing the potential energy function and thus the Hamiltonian.) The change happens effectively instantaneously compared to the time required for the atom to react. The atom suddenly finds itself in a non-eigenstate, the nature of which will govern how the atom changes in time to respond to the nuclear decay. The superposition of eigenfunctions of the new Hamiltonian will give a description of the atom immediately following the decay, and the overall wavefunction will evolve in time based on how it is predicted to do so according to the fifth postulate.\n\nThe superposition theorem allows for a complete description of a wavefunction according to the needs to the quantum theory - even if the wavefunction being described by a superposition of states is not an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian!

  "summary": "Superposition is a fundamental concept in quantum physics where multiple quantum states can coexist simultaneously. Here's a summary of superposition based on the provided documents:\n\n1. In quantum science, objects like electrons and photons have wave-like properties that can combine and become superposed.\n\n2. Quantum superposition is described mathematically as probability waves, representing the likelihood of an object existing in different states or having particular properties.\n\n3. An electron in superposition can be thought of as existing in multiple states at once, such as having different velocities or being in two places simultaneously.\n\n4. Superposition can be demonstrated through experiments, such as the double-slit experiment, where individual electrons create an interference pattern as if they traveled through both slits as a wave.\n\n5. In mathematical terms, superposition can be understood as an equation with multiple solutions, similar to how x^2 = 4 can have solutions of both 2 and -2.\n\n6. The superposition principle allows any well-behaved quantum wavefunction to be expressed as a linear combination of eigenfunctions of the system's Hamiltonian.\n\n7. When a quantum system is in a superposition of states, measuring a property like energy will yield one of the possible values with a probability determined by the coefficients of the superposition.\n\nUnderstanding superposition is crucial for advancing quantum technologies like quantum computers and explaining various quantum phenomena.\n\nSources:\n[1] https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-superposition (Similarity: 0.66, Credibility: 0.95)\n[2] https://quantumatlas.umd.edu/entry/superposition/ (Similarity: 0.58, Credibility: 0.90)\n[3] https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Quantum_Chemistry_with_Applications_in_Spectroscopy_(Fleming)/02%3A_Particle_in_a_Box/2.05%3A_Superposition_and_Completeness (Similarity: 0.18, Credibility: 0.85)"
